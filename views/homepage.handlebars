  <!-- handlebars has helpers to perform functions -->
  <!-- this helper is afor loop, simply write #each -->
  <!-- it will loop through each object of the specified array -->
  <!-- the array in this case is posts -->
 <ol class="post-list">
  <!-- we can also declare variable name, we name the object |post| -->
  {{#each posts as |post|}}
  <li>
    {{> post-info post}}
  </li>
    <!-- we end the for loop with a closing tag -->
 
  {{/each}}
</ol>
